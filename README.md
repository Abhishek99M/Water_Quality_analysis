# Water Quality Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze and assess water quality using various data analysis techniques. The goal is to identify key water quality indicators and provide insights into the factors affecting water quality.

## Project Status: In Progress 

Currently, the project is under development. Data collection and initial exploratory analysis are complete, with ongoing work on developing predictive models and data visualization.

## Objectives

- Collect and preprocess water quality data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- Develop models to predict water quality based on different parameters.
- Visualize the results to identify trends and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various water quality indicators such as pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and more. Data is sourced from publicly available datasets or collected through field measurements.

## Files

- `water_quality_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for data loading, preprocessing, EDA, and initial modeling.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample datasets used for analysis (ensure data privacy if using real data).

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd water-quality-analysis
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook water_quality_analysis.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to perform water quality analysis.

## Current Progress
